# Backend

This is the backend for the website and manages the server as well as the database management.

It consists of an Express server that pulls data from a MongoDB database, creating the standard MERN stack.

In the future, it's possible that we will use Amazon S3 in order to store images and similar large resources in a file server.

This would allow us to introduce powerful functionality such as having multiple images per item and an actual industry-standard (probably not but still) stack rather than whatever this is.
